# Website V6

This is Version 6 of my website. I decided to rework my website in order to use technologies that are more commonly used, such as Angular for the front end and Java Spring for the backend.


## Usage

The latest version of my website should be live at www.EduardoCanHelp.com. This version introduced a new tab for my portfolio. I also integrate more responsiveness accross the website including and especially for mobile users. Feel free to use my website as a template for your own.
